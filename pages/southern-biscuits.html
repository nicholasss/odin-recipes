    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biscuits are different baked goods, depending on which side of the Atlantic ocean you are on. The North American biscuit would be similar to a scone in the UK, but with a fluffier crumb. They both evolved from hard tack, which was originally made with only flour and water.</p>
    <p>In the south-eastern US, wheat would typically have less protein. This lead to flour that was easier to use in quick breads, like the biscuit. Prior to national food supply chains, across New England and the Midwest only high-protein flours were available.</p>
    <p>Today, modern recipes typically include chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda, and a shortener such as lard or butter. As well, its typical to see either milk or buttermilk. They are typically rolled out and cut into shape.</p>
