    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Blueberries are native to North America. American Indians and First Peoples called them 'Star Fruits' or 'Star Berries' likely due to the star-shaped blossom on the underside of each berry.</p>
    <p>Muffins being an old European invention would not have included blueberries from the start. Rather, once the colonization of North America began, blueberries became a staple in baked goods with fruits.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or just grease the tin directly.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently fold in the fresh blueberries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about three-quarters full.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the muffins from the oven and allow them to cool in the tin for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
