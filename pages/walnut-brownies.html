    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Brownies are a uniquely american baked desert bar, invented for women to eat for the Chicago World's Fair. Originally with walnuts and an apricot glaze. It only took a few years before the accoutrement were dropped in favor of the simple brownie.</p>
    <p>While not uniquely southern itself, the addition of nuts such as walnuts and pecans are common in the southern US. Adding walnuts back into the brownie recipe brings some southern flair.</p>
