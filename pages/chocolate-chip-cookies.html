    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are so simple and ubiquitous that it seems inevitable they would be invented. A type of drop cookie, they have chocolate morsels (or chopped chocolate) as the titular ingredient.</p>
    <p>Likely popularized by soldiers from Massachusetts during World War II, who received the cookies in care packages, they are now loved the world over.</p>
